The blood donation app has 2 sets of users: Admins and Users.
Admins are responsible for inputting the hospital/blood donation camp details at the start of the program.
Once a user is registered, they can place a request for a particular type of blood.
A request is considered "urgent", if the blood type requested is rare.
These requests by users will be visible to the admin, on loggin-in to the admin portal.
The admin can assign a particular request to a blood bank (if not urgent) or to a registered donor directly in case of an emergency (or if a blood bank is not available)
Once the request has been assigned to a donor, the request can be seen by the user (donor) on logging-in to their user portal.
The donor can choose to accept or reject the request, in the latter case, the request will again be visible in the admin portal.
